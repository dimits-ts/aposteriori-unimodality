It's easy to hide behind sarcasm and aggression when you're not willing to engage in a genuine conversation. @ReclusivePoet31 and @MeditativeMonk81 have both made thoughtful points about the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment, and you've responded with nothing but vitriol. \\n\\nYour assertion that the world isn't a safe space is not only obvious, but also irrelevant to the conversation at hand. We're not discussing the existence of hate speech or marginalization, but rather how we choose to address it. And as for your comment about @ReclusivePoet31 being a victim, I think it's clear that you're the one who's trying to control the narrative by dismissing their experiences and perspectives.\\n\\n@MeditativeMonk81, I appreciate your thoughtful response and your commitment to creating a compassionate and inclusive space. I think your words are a powerful reminder that we should strive to understand each other's perspectives, rather than resorting to aggression and sarcasm.</th>\n",

       "      <th>@SkepticalInvestor77, I appreciate your input, but you're missing the point just like the rest of 'em. I never said Jesus wasn't a refugee, I was talking about the immigrants today. And I never said they were all angels either, but they're not all criminals sent by cartels. You're painting with a broad brush, just like those who say all immigrants are here to steal jobs. It's not that simple, and you know it.\\n\\nAs for you @CryptoBro89, you're right about one thing, our system is a mess. But that doesn't mean we should just throw our hands up and say let's just keep kicking the can down the road. We need to roll up our sleeves and fix it. And that means finding a balance, respecting our laws, and treating people with dignity. It's not about being naive or cruel, it's about finding a middle ground.\\n\\nAnd @GamerNerd99, I hear your heart, but you're being a bit idealistic. We can't just let everyone in because it feels good. We've got to have order, and that means following the rules. But that doesn't mean we can't make those rules fairer, and treat people with kindness while we do it.\\n\\nNow, I'm not saying I've got all the answers. But I know we can't keep going like this. We need to talk, really talk, about how to make things better. And that means listening to each other, even when we disagree. So, let's try to keep it civil, folks. We're all in this together, whether we like it or not.</th>\n",

And let's not forget, he was a refugee too. As for the stats, you're both cherry-picking. According to the CATO Institute, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. But you know what? Let's not even focus on stats. We're talking about human beings here, not numbers. They're seeking a better life, just like our ancestors did. It's not about breaking the law, it's about survival. And if you're going to use the Bible, let's use Matthew 25:40 - Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. They're not least of these because they're immigrants. They're least of these because they're human beings in need.</th>\n",
