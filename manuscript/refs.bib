It is shown that the test has a prescribed level of significance protection against error of the first kind for any combination of true hypotheses. The power properties of the test and a number of possible applications are also discussed.},

    abstract = "Distance from unimodality (DFU) has been found to correlate well with human judgment for the assessment of polarized opinions. However, its un-normalized nature makes it less intuitive and somewhat difficult to exploit in machine learning (e.g., as a supervised signal). In this work a normalized version of this measure, called nDFU, is proposed that leads to better assessment of the degree of polarization. Then, we propose a methodology for K-class text classification, based on nDFU, that exploits polarized texts in the dataset. Such polarized instances are assigned to a separate K+1 class, so that a K+1-class classifier is trained. An empirical analysis on three datasets for abusive language detection, shows that nDFU can be used to model polarized annotations and prevent them from harming the classification performance. Finally, we further exploit nDFU to specify conditions that could explain polarization given a dimension and present text examples that polarized the annotators when the dimension was gender and race.

    abstract = "The perceived toxicity of language can vary based on someone{'}s identity and beliefs, but this variation is often ignored when collecting toxic language datasets, resulting in dataset and model biases. We seek to understand the *who*, *why*, and *what* behind biases in toxicity annotations. In two online studies with demographically and politically diverse participants, we investigate the effect of annotator identities (*who*) and beliefs (*why*), drawing from social psychology research about hate speech, free speech, racist beliefs, political leaning, and more. We disentangle *what* is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three characteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect, and vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity and beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative annotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were less likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE as toxic. We additionally present a case study illustrating how a popular toxicity detection system{'}s ratings inherently reflect only specific beliefs and perspectives. Our findings call for contextualizing toxicity labels in social variables, which raises immense implications for toxic language annotation and detection."

We survey 17,280 participants to understand how user expectations for what constitutes toxic content differ across demographics, beliefs, and personal experiences. We find that groups historically at-risk of harassment--such as people who identify as LGBTQ+ or young adults--are more likely to to flag a random comment drawn from Reddit, Twitter, or 4chan as toxic, as are people who have personally experienced harassment in the past. Based on our findings, we show how current one-size-fits-all toxicity classification algorithms, like the Perspective API from Jigsaw, can improve in accuracy by 86\% on average through personalized model tuning. Ultimately, we highlight current pitfalls and new design directions that can improve the equity and efficacy of toxic content classifiers for all users.},

Researchers have used LLM-generated data for data augmentation and prototyping, as well as for direct analysis where LLMs acted as proxies for real human subjects. LLM-based synthetic data build on fundamentally different epistemological assumptions than previous synthetically generated data and are justified by a different set of considerations. In this essay, we explore the various ways in which LLMs have been used to generate research data and consider the underlying epistemological (and accompanying methodological) assumptions. We challenge some of the assumptions made about LLM-generated data, and we highlight the main challenges that social sciences and humanities need to address if they want to adopt LLMs as synthetic data generators.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Sociologica}, author={Rossi, Luca and Harrison, Katherine and Shklovski, Irina}, year={2024}, month={Jan.}, pages={145–168} }

abstract = {This article discusses the promising potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for survey research, including generating responses to survey items. LLMs can address some of the challenges associated with survey research regarding question-wording and response bias. They can address issues relating to a lack of clarity and understanding but cannot yet correct for sampling or nonresponse bias challenges. While LLMs can assist with some of the challenges with survey research, at present, LLMs need to be used in conjunction with other methods and approaches. With thoughtful and nuanced approaches to development, LLMs can be used responsibly and beneficially while minimizing the associated risks.}
