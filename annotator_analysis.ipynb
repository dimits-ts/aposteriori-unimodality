You're acting like every illegal alien is a murderer just because of a statistic. That's like saying every American is a criminal because some commit crimes. It's ridiculous. And yes, we should acknowledge facts, but we should also acknowledge that correlation doesn't imply causation. Just because illegal aliens make up a higher percentage of murderers doesn't mean they're more likely to commit murder. It could be due to a multitude of factors, like poverty, lack of education, or even racial profiling. So, let's not jump to conclusions and start blaming an entire group of people.
